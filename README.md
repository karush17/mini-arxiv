## Introduction
This repository is a collection of short summaries of papers in Deep Learning. Summaries are based on papers which explore novel groundbreaking ideas or consist of theoretically rich concepts. 1 short summary is typically added each week which explores essential aspects of the work, its technical innovation and new questions and ideas raised by the work. Length of each summary is 1 page. Each summary is based on a fixed set of guidlines which are given [here](#guidlines). If you would like to contribute to the summaries then please read [this](#contributions).

## <a name="guidlines"></a>Summary Guidlines
This section outlines the guidlines which are used to write summaries for the repository. Note that these guidlines must be strictly followed for providing high quality summaries to the reader. 

### Paper Selection
Since Deep Learning is a fast-moving field, papers can span a broad variety of topics. In order to shorten the range of literature, papers must be selected using the following rules-  
* Any review paper, survey or a long article should not be considered since these are themselves a review of previous works and reviewing them would defeat the purpose of literature writing.
* Short papers, Journal papers and theoretical works are suitable as these present a single idea which may be of interest to the reader.
* Papers containing experimental results balanced with theory are encouraged as these validate the practical applications of the proposed methods.
* There is no constraint on the publication date and time of papers. However, papers which date back to the 'AI Winter' are highly encouraged since these provide insights which were never looked at for a very long time.
* Papers containing simply applications of pre-existing methods to various regimes are not preferred since they do not provide any new insights into the algorithm itself and only deal with its applicability.
* Workshop papers and incomplete works are also welcome as researchers can always build on these ideas.
* While there is no specific restriction on the content of papers, writer must consider fields in AI which are growing and require a new outlook, eg. Reinforcement Learning, Gradient-Free methods, Meta-Learning, Natural Language at Scale, Explainability, etc.


### Introduction
This section provides points on writing a good introduction for the summary. Note that these points are not strict and only serve as a guiding principle for drafting a good introduction.  
* The introduction should be a high-level idea of the paper and what the work deals with.
* The writer must refrain from going into any technical detail and highlight the broad idea of the work and its scope.
* No mathematical terms, definitions, technical explanations or algorithmic details should be provided to the reader.
* The main focus should be on the problem statement and how the method aims to solve this.
* Key takeaway- Detail is your enemy!


### Methodology
This section deals with the proposed method and its essential aspects in solving the problem highlighted in the introduction section. Following points serve as a guide to writing this section-  
* The content must provide a brief overview of the method. This informs the reader about what he is getting into.
* Once an overview has been provided, the draft can start diving into the detail which should be highlighted intuitively.
* Mathematical details must be followed by words, complicated terminology must be explained intuitively using examples or instances from work.
* Reasons related to technical details and there usage must be provided to the reader. The whole point of reading a summary is to crisply go over the details of the paper without wanting to read the entire text.
* While the draft should highlight the method and its details, it should also provide the reader with insights from the writer's point of view. These could consist of specific reasons for selecting a set of parameter values, usage of a specific technique existing in literature, novel contributions and the reason behind its usage and any improvements/changes from previous works.
* Key takeway- Intuition is king!


### Critical Analysis
The critical analysis section deals with the writer's analysis and understanding of the method. Specifically, this section should highlight what the writer thinks about the proposed approach, its strengths, weaknesses and potential areas of improvement and applicability. This is the most important section of the summary since the writer needs to critically evaluate and comment on the technical aspects of the work. The following points should be kept in mind while writing a good critical analysis-
* One should evaluate all aspects of the work before diving into this section. A comprehensive analysis of the work is essential as it builds on the writer's understanding of the method.
* Once the complete details have been established, a proper structure for evaluation should be constructed. Typically, this structure should consist of comments on motivational aspects, strengths, weaknesses, novel contributions, applicability of the method, extensions and improvements of the method's components and their shortcomings. 
* The draft should be written in a critical yet formal manner. For instance, the writer must highlight the intriguing aspects of the algorithm and at the same time throw light on its critical parts in a decorous manner.
* Writer's comments should be their own and not focus on explaining the work. The main idea behind this section is to present your understanding of the text to the reader, not the text itself.
* Key takeway- Your own contributions matter!


### New Ideas/Questions
This section follows and builds upon the critical analysis section. The main idea behind this section is to highlight and examine the novel contributions of the proposed method and their contributions towards improving prior techniques. Another reason to study new ideas proposed by a paper is to identify potential directions of research and answer open questions from different perspectives. Following points may come in handy while writing this section-
* One should concisely summarize the novel contributions of the work (not more than 1-2 sentences).
* The summary should be followed by a critical analysis or a set of possible questions which maybe asked while using the novel aspects of the method.
* Since the focus is on novelty, writer may also be interested in asking questions related to other potential techniques and their applicability in place of the novel method.
* The section should conclude with brief comments on substitutes/extensions to the novel components and questions left unanswered (if any) in the work.
* Key takeway- Questions, Questions, Questions! 

### Conclusions
Lastly, the conclusions section should clearly and concisely sum up the summary of the work. This section should consist of a crisp summary of all the previous sections and only highlight their most important aspects. The content of this section should be directed to someone who does not have enough time to read the summary and only wishes to grab the essential points. A good conlusion could be written using the following points-
* The summary should start with a high level introductory note of the method, its usage and contributions. (not more 1-2 sentences)
* The summary should explore the novelty of the method, its implications and the resulting outcome achieved from the writer's point of view.
* The summary should walk over the key components of writer's evaluation and his comments on the method.
* The summary should conclude with a brief note of new ideas/questions introduced by the work and potential directions for future work.
* Key takeway- Just be done already!
